<h3>Ideals</h3>
<ul>
<li>Very difficult to change yourself through intellectual learning alone. You must engage in daily processes to make knowledge actionable (meditation is the best such daily process I've found).</li>
<li>The byproduct of challenging yourself is mistakes. Make them every day. Approach yourself with compassion and mistakes become valuable lessons rather than crippling failures.</li>
<li>Patience + impatience + curiosity + empathy are key qualities for positive change</li>
<li>Don't guard your own ideas as if they are more precious than others'. Speak them. Improve them.</li>
<ul>
