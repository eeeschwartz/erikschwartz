<p>Hi! I'm Erik Schwartz a 2014 <a href="http://codeforamerica.org">Code for America</a> Fellow <a href="http://teambiglex.tumblr.com/">in partnership</a>
with the Great City of Lexington, KY.</p>
<p>Before joining forces with CfA I was a long-time partner/developer at
 <a href="http://www.tablexi.com/who-we-are/team/erik-schwartz">Table XI</a>,
 a <a href="http://eeeschwartz.github.io/voltage/index.html">musician</a>,
 <a href="http://www.secondcity.com/">performer</a>,
 and <a href="http://schwartzography.com/">nomad</a>.
</p>
<p>
 I aspire to be both a skillful inventor and consummate teammate in the pursuit of socially-meaningful projects. I'm incredibly lucky to spend time on a daily basis with the wonderously-talented <a href="http://smithschwartz.com">Smith Schwartz</a>.
</p>

<h3>Ideals</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Very difficult to change yourself through intellectual learning alone. You must engage in daily processes to make knowledge actionable (meditation is the best such daily process I've found).</li>
    <li>The byproduct of challenging yourself is mistakes. Make them every day. Approach yourself with compassion and mistakes become valuable lessons rather than crippling failures.</li>
    <li>Patience + impatience + curiosity + empathy are key qualities for positive change.</li>
    <li>Don't guard your own ideas as if they are more precious than others'. Speak them. Improve them.</li>
    <li>Otherwise, be sure to spend some time raising the roof with your favorite peoples.</li>
  </ul>
