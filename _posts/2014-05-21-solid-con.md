## Blue City

* Hardware infrastructure to pipe point of observation data to the platform
* Aggregate various atmospheric city data through resident sensors on phones and other devices
* BlueData platform to aggregate multiple data sources
* saha@bluecityllc.com


## Data Vehicles for Open Mobility in Cities
* Kabal Farah (MIT Media Lab)
* City is a collection of desire paths
* Map connections being created in space via mobile
* First distruptive technology
	* the car
	* 15,000,000 sold in first wave
* Self driving cars
	* You experience city in new way
		* Office space
		* Familiy Space
	* BAEDE-KAR: 8-track faux-gps
	* Ford releasing Open XC API
	* The car becomes aware of its technology
		* Starts to approach automation of high-tech warehouses of today
* Build up preferences, experiences
	* City is able to predict what is next for you, for everyone
	* Creepy?
	
## IoT and Restful Hardware
* Alden Hart - Synthetos
* Motion control sensors, motor controllers for CnC machines.
* TinyG montion controller. Takes Gcode directly. 6-way motion
* They got the electronics working but people didn't like integrating with unstructured text protocol
* They wanted to eliminate begel bone or raspberry pi as a base requirement, only as enchancement
* They looked to REST and Fielding's work where state resides on server
* Need well defined resource model that describes machine very well
* They replaced server with their chip
* They use JSON support directly on hardware
* Run JSON right over traces
* Wrote their own parser, strict and relaxed mode
* 7 microseconds strtof() < 7uSec on 84 MHz ARM Cortex M3
* JSON subset
	* 7bit utf
	* no linefeeds
	* Flat namespace, don't go wild nesting
* POST means execute
* cheats
	* No request headers. `null` means `get`
	* They're all point to point
	* Will execute Gcode directly, doesn't have to be wrapped in JSON
	
* Use footers to verify integrity
* Have event reporting to communicate state deltas
* "Don't innovate. Copy"
	* Use $ as root (from JSONpath)
	* @ prefix for adressing, binding, routing
	* \# topic prefix
	* ! priority. Jump the queue
* Why not protocol buffers?
	* To support late binding of devices
	* telehash has binary payloads which is cool. Another possibility
	
## Smart Design: Attention to microinteractions to go from prototype to product
* Water watcher
	* Contextual feedback about usage.
	* Immediate indication
* Difference between prototype and product
	* prototype: demo a feature
	* product is separated from prototype by many microinteractions
		* change a setting, log in, error recovery, ....
		* consider apple with one button OBE versus some thing you have to debug immediately
		* toaster with the 'a little bit more' button. They know their UX.
		* product is prototype after you remove all the 'pebbles in your shoe'
		* Slate is upselling improved microinteractions (comments in-line and reduced pagination)		
* Anatomy of a microinteraction. Be deliberate about:
	* trigger
		* Nest smoke detector glows and beeps so you can find the one with batteries low
	* rules
		* OSX fans turn down when you're dictating
	* feedback
		* Ford shows leaves next to MPG which cause behavior change in drivers
	* Loops and Modes
	
## Announcing a Product Before It's Ready - Stories From the Frontlines
* Jason Johnson, August Home Inc
* Using (Near field communication) NFC for doorlocks
* Bluetooth 4.0
* Yves Behar's design
* ODM (original design manufacturer): someone with a product you can build on

## The Collision of Privacy, Regulation, and Physical Computing
*  Chris Clearfield (System Logic) 
... joined late

* On-star
	* Asked about being hacked and GM declared it 'Read-Only'. "Until someone figures out otherwise"
* Mobile radios
	* Mobile Devices - Base band processors in common consumer phones
	* History of being hacked: full access to filesystem proof-of-concept
* Data and privacy within stores
	* Use wifi MAC addresses to track people consistently
	* "Conversnitch" - plug-in lightbulb replacement with mic that pushes to Mechanical Turk and Twitter
* Private companies collection
	* If data breach or legally compelled to give over your data, it's hugely telling of your life

* Charles Perrow on collisions between tech and privacy
	* Organizations struggle to manage high risk systems
		* One failure leads to more: such tight coupling
		* So many org and people boundaries
			* Mat Honan example of confidence escalation
		* Two-factor accounts help with caveats
* Hard to control in the expanding network
	* Cars
	* Fridges
	* TVs
	* Phones
	* Meta-data up for grabs
* Solutions
	* Cultivate sensitivity. Be intentional
	* Coupling yields problems
	* Take organizational approach: designate sceptics on your design team
	
## Testing across weird interfaces and devices
* Jason Huggins (Sauce Labs Inc) @hugs
* Nike fuel band needs to shake to test the app that captures its date
* iPhone app to open your zipcar
	* you need a phone and a car
* You can pay zillions to build simulators that might be wrong
* @hugs has developed a robot tester: Tapster
	* (Low to High level testing pyramid) Unit -> Service -> Simulators -> Real World
	* He shipped 70ish to phone manufacturers, other companies
* To create your own tester bot
	* Don't spend 50k for a human hand robot
	* Write a robot, motors, rubber pads, etc
* Manufacturers prefer reality
* Everthing on earth needs testing. Either you do it or your users do.
* Tapster in action: * http://youtu.be/in2av9LtCfE

## Disrupting Space: Planet Labs From Garage to Orbit
* Chris Boshuizen (Planet Labs) 
* 31 Satellites in orbit
* Map the earth every day
* Bring awareness to earth through information they generate
* Rapid feedback for the planet
* Blue Marble Pic (Apollo 17 on way to moon in 1972)
* No space startups in last few decades
* PhoneSat. When Chris was at NASA
	* Off the shelf Google nexus 1 with extra batteries
	* Design a package to withstand space
	* Crowdsourced retrieval of picture from space to HAM radio community
	* Demo'd idea but phone was limited
		* No peripheral connectivity
	* Out of this came Planet labs to create better satellites
* Planet Labs
	* Bootstrapped for a while in Cuptertino
	* Hard to get rocket in space
		* Space launches slipped 18 and 12 months each
	* They got their sats launched from the space station
