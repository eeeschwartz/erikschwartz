### A Great Start to the Fellowship
The first month of [Code for America](http://codeforamerica.org) training was a total blast. My cohort is a great group with all kinds of perspective on the challenge of improving the connection of people with their government. I’ve learned a lot from my new colleagues, among them astronaut interface designers, ex-Googlers, researchers, map-makers, circus performers, powerful developers and sharp designers. 

The month of training itself was challenging in all of the right ways. We talked with luminaries like Tim O’Reilly, Jen Pahlka, Aneesh Chopra, Eric Ries, Steve Van Roekel, and many more. We did hands on negotiation training. Focused on good team dynamics. Learned the nuts and bolts of local gov. Worked on a small-scale hack project with SF city officials. Practiced self-organization. Great experience.

### Off to our new favorite place: Lexington, KY
Tomorrow my [most](https://twitter.com/livienyin) [excellent](https://twitter.com/lyzidiamond) teammates and I fly to Lexington, KY where we will live for the next month. We put our training to use as we learn as much as possible from our city partners, community members, civic hackers, and local aficionados about all that is Lexington. February sets the stage for the work we will build with the good folks of the Bluegrass over the course of the fellowship year. Everyone we've talked to at [city hall](http://www.lexingtonky.gov/), the [CfA brigade](http://openlexington.org), and the community has been fully enthusiastic and gracious. It's going to be an excellent year of collaboration and growth for all involved. [Team Big Lex](http://teambiglex.tumblr.com/) is fired up.
