It's been 6 years since we played our last show so I decided to flatten out the old php site and [throw it up](http://github.com/eeeschwartz/voltage) on github.

It had cutting edge javascript-keystroke navigation technology to mimic terminal-based systems. We're talking 2002 after all!

It's amazing how different the world was back then. The remaining pictures I can find of our performances are mostly in analog form in my box of memorabilia. Fast forward to the era of ubiquitous photo sharing and amount of documentation per event has shot through the roof.

I have more pictures of my friends eating pizza in the last six months than I do of our 5 years of voltage performances.
