## CMS free

Prediction
------
Browser-based editors will emerge that make jekyll feel like wordpress and the world is crazy ready.

Static Site Generators
-----
Currently static-site generators are the domain of tech-dweebs who aren't afraid of firing off a few scripts from the command line. Most people who have played with jekyll, middleman, or the go-based (thus incredibly fast to compile) hugo are instant converts. These tools make it incredibly easy to create and host a maintainable, secure, blog-oriented site with completely badass performance. The site is just static files after all. 

Get an idea for a funny/useful/edutational site late one night and you can buy a domain and host for free on github pages in a matter of minutes. No more sleep. Make web better all day!
