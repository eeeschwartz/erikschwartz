Title: Jekyll for the masses (almost)
---

### Prediction

Browser-based editors will emerge that make jekyll feel like wordpress and the world is crazy ready.

### Static Site Generators

Currently static-site generators are the domain of techno-dweebs who aren't afraid of putzing around on the command line to publish a blog post. And once these people get familiar with [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), [middleman](http://middlemanapp.com/), or [hugo](https://github.com/spf13/hugo) (which is go-based and incredibly fast to compile) they are lifetime converts. These tools make it incredibly easy to create and host a maintainable, secure, blog-oriented site with completely badass performance. The site is just static files after all.

Get an idea for an edutational site late one night and you can buy a domain and host for free on github pages in a matter of minutes. It's pretty amazing.

### The <strike>Challenge</strike> Huge Opportunity
Every single small business/personal website in the universe should be using this workflow, if only the barriers to entry were a bit lower. Which is where the excellent [prose.io](http://prose.io/#about) project enters the picture.

Prose makes jekyll feel more like wordpress. It's a web-based content editor. Once a jekyll site is [configured](https://github.com/prose/prose/wiki/Getting-Started) with prose, the world starts to look like this:![Prose workflow](/images/prose-screenshot.png)

instead of this:
![Jekyll workflow](/images/vim-screenshot.png)
Which is exactly what is needed to bring jekyll to the massess, where it belongs.

### What's left to be done?
Setting up and configuring jekyll and prose is still the domain of hackers. In the next year we will start to see jeykll consultants pop-up to fulfill this need. Then we elicit feedback: what do normal users struggle with, how can we make the workflow more accessible.

I'm in the process of using this workflow myself to see what gaps exist and where I might [contribute to prose](https://github.com/prose/prose/blob/gh-pages/CONTRIBUTING.md).

Static site generators are headed for a broad audience and a bright future. The world is ready.
